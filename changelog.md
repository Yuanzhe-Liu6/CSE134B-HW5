I have added the blog page on my site, which enables the users to leave comments on my site, also I am planning to make it a discussion board place. Because I want to create a website that can help international students to find their dream job. The other pages I have so far have information about where and how to find a job, and I have also included the content about how to ace interviews. But that information may be boring and not so trivial when first looking at it. But with this new blog page, people can share their own experience on my site, and those live stories may help out those who are really confused about their future.

I have adjust the style of the overall site, so the blog page can fit into my site.

Added some more javascript to my job page, so when the users select different options on my page will get different outcome(when they select different major, the recommended job will be different).

Add more javascript code on my resume site, so the resume site will be more interactive and fun to use(people get different advise base on their major. STEM vs non-STEM).

I am planning to embed algolia to enable in-site search, so the users could find more interesting stuff online, and not just limited to the content on my site.
